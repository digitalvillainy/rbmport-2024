                Hi, my name is Roberto Rivera and I’ve been a Full-Stack web developer since 2018. During that time I
                have learned that flexibility is key. Sometimes I get to make a website from scratch, other times I have
                to dive into a established code base and work with what I have. Let’s see what I can do for you.
